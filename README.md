## TP1

Building a scene using a XML language file, which contained specifications for objects of the scene, including spacial coordinates, texture image to be used and material, and lights.

## TP2

Building a scene using the previous project but implementing animations for scene objects. Animations, like the objects, are parsed from the XML file. This project also contains insights on shadering.

## TP3

Building a board game using PROLOG program as a server(made in PLOG course at FEUP) containing all that was learned in the previous two projects and some more knowledge like picking an object.
