# FEUP-LAIG

Repository to host 3 projects done in LAIG course at FEUP

## TP1

Building a scene using a XML language file, which contained specifications for objects of the scene, including spacial coordinates, texture image to be used and material, and lights.

## TP2

Building a scene using the previous project but implementing animations for scene objects. Animations, like the objects, are parsed from the XML file. This project also contains insights on shadering.
